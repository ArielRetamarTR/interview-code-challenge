<pre>
  Here we have a list of employees, each employee has a name, a position, and a salary.

  Add a link to each employee name, so that when I click on the name, I can see the details
  of the selected employee on the right.

  Optional: sort the list of employees salary in ascending order.

  - Note: the employee details component already exists. Don't forget to give it a look before
  you start crafting the solution.
